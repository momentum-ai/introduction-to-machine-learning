# Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence Summer-Workshop

You can run keras (an interface to tensorflow) directly in the browser without installing the python libraries on your machine using Googles Collaboratory tool.

You must open a notebook, click "Open in playground" to get your own version (and accept that it is not created by Google).

Then read the code, ask for help when it is unclear(!), and run one cell at a time. Make sure not to miss any cell, or run them twice â€“ start over if anything is not working.

### Notebooks:

- [MNIST](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CQNqdLp4sMOCyGiCgZic57D42xbjRf9y#scrollTo=cttxuQgZjtJl), recognizing 
- [Text Generation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v8kVoM_Gn_E7LlykZLqYrtc8U-eY7Nt_)
- [Neural Network based Calculator](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zA-B4QszWnmaqtRd3PE9XBoFCdX47kUq#scrollTo=1Wkt7b8rzTI0)

After looking at some examples you can modify the networks or start using keras to play with your own data. For example by downloading data from https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets
