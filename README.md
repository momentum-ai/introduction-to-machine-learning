# Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence Summer-Workshop

You can run keras (an interface to tensorflow) directly in the browser without installing the python libraries on your machine using Googles Collaboratory tool.

Do it by opening a notebook, clicking "Open in playground" to get your own copy (and accept that it is not created by Google).

Then read the code, ask for help when it is unclear what is happening(!), and run one cell at a time. Make sure not to miss any cell, and just start over from the top if anything is not working.

### Notebooks:

- [MNIST](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1CQNqdLp4sMOCyGiCgZic57D42xbjRf9y#scrollTo=cttxuQgZjtJl) (recognizing images of digits)
- [Text Generation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v8kVoM_Gn_E7LlykZLqYrtc8U-eY7Nt_) (learning to generate the same text as Nietzche would have written)
- [Neural Network based Calculator](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zA-B4QszWnmaqtRd3PE9XBoFCdX47kUq#scrollTo=1Wkt7b8rzTI0) (learning addition of numbers by example)

After looking at some examples you can modify the networks or start using keras to play with your own data. For example by downloading data from https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets
